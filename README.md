<h1>Validator.js</h1>

<p>Simple Validation Class for JavaScript.</p>

<p>This is really just a collection of common validation functions stuck on an object literal - calling it a class, while accurate, sounds a little more breathy than is deserved.</p>

<p>This is far from complete, and contains mostly string tests (for user input).  There's been very little debug and no documentation - if anyone has anything to add (or modify), please feel free to fork and I'll pull anything that looks handy.  These functions are very common but I've yet to find a comprehensive collection.</p>
